d 'PPMLHDFE': PPML/Poisson Regression with High-Dimensional Fixed Effects (Multi-Way Fixed Effects)
d
d ppmlhdfe implements Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regressions
d (PPML) with multi-way fixed effects, as described by Correia, 
d Guimarães, Zylkin (2019a). Advantages over standard Poisson
d commands such as -glm- include:
d  a) Support for any number of fixed effects, as in -reghdfe-
d  b) Support for two- and multi-way clustering
d  c) Robust to statistical separation and convergence issues
d  e) Includes several algorithmic improvements aimed allowing its
d     use with very large datasets
